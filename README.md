# 🌱 Game of Life in Java 🌱

</div>

## Description 📜
This project is an implementation of the famous "Game of Life" simulation by John Conway, coded in Java. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that, despite its simple rules, can produce extremely complex and fascinating behaviors.

## Features ✨
- **Graphical Interface** 🎨: Uses Swing for an intuitive interface to visualize cell evolution.
- **Customizable Parameters** ⚙️: Modify grid size and simulation speed.
- **Interactive Controls** 🖱️: Add or remove cells using right-click.
- **Zoom and Pan** 🔍: Use mouse wheel to zoom and left-click drag to move the grid.
- **Save and Load** 💾: Save favorite configurations and load them from a file.
- **Simulation Controls** ⏯️: Start, pause, clear, and manually step through the simulation.
